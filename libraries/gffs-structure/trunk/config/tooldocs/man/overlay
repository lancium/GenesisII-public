Definitions:

source-path 

An absolute or relative path in the currently connected grid RNS namespace (unless a local path is provided) which refers to a directory or file (i.e. an RNS or ByteIO resource). To indicate a local path, begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

target-path 

An absolute or relative path in the currently connected grid RNS namespace (unless a local path is provided) which refers to a directory or file, or a non-existant resource (a path for which the final element of the path does not yet exist). To indicate a local path, begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

offset

The location of the first byte in the target file where the contents of the source file will be overlayed.

Description:

Appends bytes from the source file, starting from the offset and continuing until EOF, to the target file.
