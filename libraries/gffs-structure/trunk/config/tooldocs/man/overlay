Definitions:

source-path 

An absolute or relative path in the currently connected grid RNS namespace (unless a local path is provided) which refers to a directory or file (i.e. an RNS or ByteIO resource). To indicate a local path, begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

target-path 

An absolute or relative path in the currently connected grid RNS namespace (unless a local path is provided) which refers to a directory or file, or a non-existant resource (a path for which the final element of the path does not yet exist). To indicate a local path, begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

offset

The location of the first byte in the target file where the contents of the source file will be overlayed.

Description:

Overlays all bytes from the source file into target file, starting at an offset in the target file.

If the source file length + offset is greater than the target file length, the target file will be extended to fit all new bytes.

If the offset is greater than the target file length, 0s will be between the last real target byte and the first overlaid source byte.
