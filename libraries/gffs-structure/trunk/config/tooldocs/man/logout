Definitions:

--pattern=<certificate/token pattern> | --all | --complete
    This optional flag determines the logout that will be performed. The value --complete means that a total logout will be performed (all certificates or token patterns will be removed). The value --all logs out of all credentials but keeps the TLS certificate. The --pattern option allows you to choose the exact credentials you would like to remove, given a string that the credential contains. The default behavior is to query the user for the credentials to remove.

Description:

The logout command is used to remove authentication information from the user's context.
