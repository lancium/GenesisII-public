Description:

The replicate tool creates, lists, clears, and destroys replicas. <source-path> is an RNS path to any resource. <container> is an RNS path to a container resource. The replica will be created in this container.

If the source's EPR does not contain a resolver element, then the replicate tool will abort. (See the "resolver" tool.)

The replicate tool returns immediately, but the new replica remains locked until it has downloaded all of the state data from the source. After the replica has finished downloading, it will accept read and write requests. The source and the replica use subscriptions to keep their states synchronized.

The replicate tool tells the resolver that the new replica exists.

The options are:

-p | --policy

-l | --list	Lists all of the replicas of the resource

-d | --destroy	Destroys the specified instance.

-c | --clear	This command is used to reset the replication status of a resource when the Resolver resource is no longer available, and will never be available again. Note that all replica's are turned into orphans. 

Examples

Suppose newfile1 is a replicated file

replicate -l newfile 
will list all of the replicas, their ID number, the DNS addreess of the container where the replica is located, and the container ID.
Genesis II:\$> replicate -l new1
Replica 1: https://10.0.2.15:18080: container-id=581BEB33-A83B-325E-6C40-44055AAB212E
Replica 3: https://10.0.2.15:18080: container-id=581BEB33-A83B-325E-6C40-44055AAB212E
Replica 4: https://10.0.2.15:18080: container-id=581BEB33-A83B-325E-6C40-44055AAB212E

All three of the above replicas are in the same container.

replicate -d newfile 3
will destroy the replica with the replica ID of 3
Set the given directory's policy to "auto-replicate". When an auto-replicating directory receives an update message which says that resource N has been added to some instance of the directory, it responds by replicating resource N in its own container before adding resource N to its contents. This option is recursive.  The replicate tool will find every subdirectory of the given directory, and it will set each one to auto-replicate.
