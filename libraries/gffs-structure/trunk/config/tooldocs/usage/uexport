export

export --create { <export-service-path> | --url <export-service-url> } 
	[--svn-user=<svn-username>] [--svn-pass=<svn-pass>] [--svn-revision=<svn-revision>]
	[--creator="<DN-filter-pattern>"]
	<local-path> [new-rns-path]

export --quit { <export-root-rns-path> | --url <export-root-url> }

export --replicate { <primary-container-name> <resolver-container-name> | --url <primary-machine-url> <resolver-machine-url> }
       <primary-local-path> [new-rns-path]

Example:

export --create --creator="/CN=Dill Pickle" /containers/khandroma_jurgis/Services/LightWeightExportPortType local:/home/jurgis/xsede/code/trunk /src/GenesisII.trunk

This creates an export of the source code "trunk" from the local file system,
where the local files are owned by a unix user named "jurgis".  Jurgis has a
grid container running on the machine which is linked into the grid at
'/containers/khandroma_jurgis'.  The source code export will reside inside the
grid at '/src/GenesisII.trunk', which will offer a view into jurgis's local
folder where the source code actually resides.
The creator flag is used because this grid user currently has multiple
identities in their credential wallet and has specified that the true creator
of the export (in the grid) should be the user known as 'Dill Pickle'.  If
that user is not found in the credentials, then the export attempt will fail.
