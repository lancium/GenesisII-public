/**
 * While the exact protocols for transferring bytes in ByteIO is extensible and therefore infinite in cardinality, the various mechanisms all
 * fall under two distinct categories -- random byteio transfers, and streamable byte io transfers. This interface represents the ability to
 * transfer bytes for the streamable byteio case. Actually, it's an almost verbatim representation of the interface supported by the ByteIO
 * specification. It wouldn't have been strictly necessary to codify this (a higher level abstraction might have been more appropriate for
 * programmers) except for the fact that for certain cases (i.e., to utilize some of the more obscure, web services related provisions such as
 * combined seek and read/write access), it was desirable in some cases to have access to this protocol at this level.
