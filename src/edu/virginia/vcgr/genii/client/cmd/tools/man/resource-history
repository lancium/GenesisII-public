Definitions:

--dump=<path>
	The path in the local file-system namespace or grid namespace where a serialized copy of the history needs to be stored. Paths in the local file system's namespace should be prefixed by "local:". If absent, the job-history is displayed without serialization.

<resource-path>
	The RNS path to the Queue resource. This is the path to the Queue where the job whose history is required, was submitted.	

[resource-hint]
	The job-ticket of the job whose job-history is required. 

Description:
	This command is used to display the job-history of a particular job. The job-history is displayed as a series of chronological events. Events are categorized as Default, CreatingJob, CreatingActivity, Scheduling, StageIn, StageOut, ReQueing, Checking, Cleanup, Terminating, CloudSetup. The job-history can be serialized and written to a file or displayed on the console without serialization. This tool has a minimum event-level of "Trace". The available event-levels are Trace, Debug, Information, Warning and Error. To set a minimum event-level while viewing job-history, the GUI QueueManager tool needs to be used.
