Definitions:

target-path 
    The RNS path of the resource whose authorization policies are to be inspected/updated 

cert-file-path
    The path to the encoded X.509 certificate file representing the identity to be added/removed from the access control list(s). To indicate a local path, make sure to begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

identity-provider-path
    The RNS path to the Identity Provider resource (i.e., a WS-Trust Security Token Service) to be added/removed from the access control list(s). 

username
    The username portion of the username-token identity to be added/removed from the access control list(s). 

password
    The password portion of the username-token identity to be added/removed from the access control list(s). 

everyone
    The catch-all "everyone"/"world" idenity to be added/removed from the access control list(s). 

octal-mode
    A single octal digit representing a 3-bit characteristic bit vector indicating the proper r/w/x membership for the specified identity. The Read, Write, and Execute lists correspond to the bits in this three-bit vector from most-significant to least-significant, respectively. 

Description:

The chmod tool gives users the ability to modify the authorization policy for a GenesisII grid resource. Authorization policies for GenesisII resources are represented as access control lists (ACLs). Operations upon a grid resource fall into one of three categories: Read, Write, and Execute (r/w/x). GenesisII resources manage three separate "allow" ACLs, one for each r/w/x category. The authz tool allows users to add and remove identities from these R/W/X ACLs.

Examples:

chmod hello.txt +r --everyone
chmod hello.txt -r-w-x /users/merrill
chmod hello.txt 4 local:merrill.cer
