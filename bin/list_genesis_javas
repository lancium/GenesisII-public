# lists processes that seem to be GenesisII java processes.  this takes one
# optional parameter that is a pattern to seek in the process info for the
# list candidates.  if the pattern is blank, all genesisII javas are shown,
# but if a pattern is provided, the process info must contain it.
#
# one example usage:
#   bash list_genesis_javas.sh backup
# should find any backup container.
