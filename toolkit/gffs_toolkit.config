# This is an example of the configuration file for the XSEDE tests and tools.
# For more information, refer to the Genesis II Omnibus reference's XSEDE
# tests section:
# http://genesis2.virginia.edu/wiki/uploads/Main/GenesisII_omnibus_reference_manual.htm

# This file uses the official xsede.org namespace.

##############

# This section defines variables that are used throughout the tests.
# Many of these need to change to suit your particular configuration.

# The name of the deployment to use.  The modern XSEDE and XCG installers use
# the name "current_grid" for this.  Other installers may provide a different
# deployment name.
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=current_grid
# For a bootstrapped test grid, the deployment can be anything other than "default".
#DEPLOYMENT_NAME=bootstrapped_grid

# The base user name is used for any paths below that refer to the user who
# will be running the tools and tests.  This should be changed to the grid
# user account under which the tools and tests will be run.  The variable is
# used to find the home directory of the user, as well as the STS location.
BASE_USER=userX

# The email variable is used for testing EMS stage-out to email.  This will be
# the recipient of emails from the running job.  This should be set to a valid
# email account where you can receive the test emails, if you plan on running
# the EMS tests.
EMAIL=userX@emailsomewhere.com

# The queue name is expected to be found under the queue storage area in the
# grid.  This should be just the queue's short name rather than a full path.
# This should be changed to the specific queue that is under test.
QUEUE_NAME=grid-queue

# How many default slots to configure when setting up a BES on a queue.
QUEUE_SLOTS=4

# Used for windows testing; provides the path to the binaries directory of cygwin.
#CYGWIN_BIN_PATH=c:/cygwin/bin

##############

#### GFFS settings...

# The folderspace variable is a parameter used within all paths in the grid.
# For example, in the xsede grid, the main users directory is /users/xsede.org
# and the resources directory is /resources/xsede.org.  This is where all
# resources that are owned by the grid's central containers can be found.
FOLDERSPACE=xsede.org

# The area in which to test.  Many junk files and directories are created
# under this path, so it should be a directory without a lot of other
# important files in it.  Note that this directory *must* be writable by
# the grid user running the tests.
RNSPATH=/home/$FOLDERSPACE/$BASE_USER/sandbox

# Path to the user identity that will be running the tests.  This needs to be
# a user that is already valid within the grid under test.  Most tests assume
# that this user is already logged in.
USERPATH=/users/$FOLDERSPACE/$BASE_USER

# The main CONTAINERPATH is used for creating export directories in some of
# the tests.  This container needs visibility of the EXPORTPATH below.
CONTAINERPATH=/resources/$FOLDERSPACE/containers/BootstrapContainer

# REMOTE/LOCAL container paths are used for GFFS Performance Testing: the user
# must have permissions to create files on these containers.  Note that the
# local container should be close on the network to the user (short number of
# hops, high bandwidth connection) whereas the remote container can be far
# away from the user.  The test will run very slowly over a low-speed WAN
# though, so it's recommended that the remote container still have high
# bandwidth available.
REMOTE_CONTAINER=/resources/$FOLDERSPACE/containers/BootstrapContainer
LOCAL_CONTAINER=/resources/$FOLDERSPACE/containers/BootstrapContainer

#   This is a path to export to the grid from the local filesystem.  Be
# careful because this is tricky; it must be a valid path that the container
# listed in CONTAINERPATH can actually see.
#   So, if you are using the bootstrap container for the grid, it is important
# to get a valid export path from the grid administrator that will actually be
# present on the root container's machine.
#   If you are running your own grid, then the local system user running the
# container must be able to see this export path.  Further, the permissions
# on that path for the container-running user id must match the desired export
# permissions (e.g., container's unix user should have write access to the
# export path if the export path would ever be written to *from* the grid).
EXPORTPATH=$HOME/export-path

##############

#### EMS settings...

# The queue to be used for submitting jobs.
QUEUE_PATH=/resources/$FOLDERSPACE/queues/$QUEUE_NAME

# The group which has rights to submit jobs on the queue, plus possibly the
# right to use any BES hooked to the queue.
SUBMIT_GROUP=/groups/$FOLDERSPACE/gffs-users

# This specifies what type of BES to test.  the options are either "Genesis"
# or "Unicore" currently.
#BES_TYPE=Unicore
BES_TYPE=Genesis

# The SPMD type needs to reflect the type of MPI in use on the BES or queue.
# This depends on knowing the external configuration for the BES.  If this is
# not set, then parallel tests will not be executed.
# Disabled:
SPMD_VARIATION=
# OpenMPI:
#SPMD_VARIATION="http://www.ogf.org/jsdl/2007/02/jsdl-spmd/OpenMPI"
# MPICH2:
#SPMD_VARIATION="http://www.ogf.org/jsdl/2007/02/jsdl-spmd/MPICH2"

# If this is not blank, then it is used as the only BES to target in the queue's
# resources.  This will not work if that resource does not exist on the queue.
BES_RESOURCE_OVERRIDE=

# How long to wait for the jobs to finish...
# The queue sleep duration is the interval between each queue check.  If this
# is too fast, the queue will be slowed down by the continual questioning.
QUEUE_SLEEP_DURATION=60
# The queue tries is the number of times the above sleep duration is allowed
# to occur in between seeing a change in the job count in the queue.  So if
# the sleep duration is 2 minutes, and this number is 30, then the queue has
# to change at least every hour or an error is reported.
QUEUE_TRIES_ALLOWED=60
# 60 tries is 2 hours worth of waiting for just one job to complete.

# These items are all for the file staging tests.  The arrays below hold these items:
#   hostname, test directory, username, password.

# gridftp settings need to be customized for testing.

#### multi-user settings for both GFFS and EMS...

# These arrays are needed for the multi-user testing.  Those tests can use up to
# 10 accounts in the array below.  Note that the account names must all be unique,
# and should provide the full path to the user location.
# Also note that the password list must have the correct passwords for each account,
# and must be in the same order as the account names.
MULTI_USER_LIST=(/users/$FOLDERSPACE/xsedetest-user1 /users/$FOLDERSPACE/xsedetest-user2 /users/$FOLDERSPACE/xsedetest-user3)

# replication test settings...

# To bootstrap a second container with a configuration that is identical
# to the $DEPLOYMENT_DIR container except for the port number,
# set the container name and port number here, and run bootstrap_backup.sh.
# The script will create the necessary configuration and deployment files.
# If the backup deployment name is commented out, then no replication
# configuration will be established for the bootstrapped test grid.
BACKUP_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=backup

# The backup container opens this port for TLS communication.
BACKUP_PORT_NUMBER=21003

# The bootstrap script will link the container at localhost:backup_port
# into the default container's RNS namespace under this name.
