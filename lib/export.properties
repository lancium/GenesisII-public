# "ACLandChown" indicates that the permissions should already be right, but
# the GFFS will also change ownership of the files to their true creator (as
# a Unix user).
#
# "ProxyIO" specifies using the sudo-based export co-process to perform all
# file actions as the Unix user owning the files.
#
# "Archive" is an unimplemented option that would use an archive file system
# for the export.
