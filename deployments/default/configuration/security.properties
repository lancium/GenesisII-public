# Property that sets the minimum configuration for outgoing and

#	"NONE" : The client does not require a minimum configuration 
#		message-level communication.  (The client will auto-upgrade
#		to the level of message-level security required by the 
#		remote container.)
#	"SIGN" : Provides (for outgoing messages) and requires (for 
#		response messages) proof of data integrity. (The client will
#		often auto-upgrade as needed to this configuration to accomodate 
#		AuthZ within certain containers.)
#	"ENCRYPT" : Provides (for outgoing messages) and requires (for

# Kerberos realm settings.
#
# Each realm must have an authorized service principal stored in a keytab file
# in order to fully authenticate and authorize users with the Kerberos
# back-end.  This must be done once for every GFFS container that will serve
# as a Kerberos STS.  It does not need to be done per user!  Further, if the
# keytab is missing, there will be complaints in the log regarding insecure
# authentication.  However, full authorization to the service principal is
# mandatory for the realm TERAGRID.ORG due to administrative requirements.
# The Kerberos realm administrator must set up a service principal for you,
# and provide you with a keytab file for that principal before you will be
# able to securely authenticate users with Kerberos.  It is insecure and not
# at all good to run an STS without a proper keytab and service principal.
#
# In the keytab entry below, the realm name should be appended to the keytab
# prefix to provide the proper keytab file for that realm.  The keytab file
# will be sought in the "security" folder next to this "configuration" folder
# in the same deployment.
# In the principal entry below, the realm name should be appended to the
# principal prefix to set the service principal that the STS should authorize
# against.
#
# An example configuration for the kerberos realm TERAGRID.ORG looks like:
#
#   gffs-sts.kerberos.keytab.TERAGRID.ORG=teragrid-flugelheimhost-keytab
#   gffs-sts.kerberos.principal.TERAGRID.ORG=gffs-sts/FLUGELHEIM.ORG@TERAGRID.ORG
#
# In general, the service principal name could be any string, but it is
# recommended that it include the phrase "gffs-sts" at the front to
# distinguish it from other types of service principals.
